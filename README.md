# CourseraPython
Codes developed following the course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" at Coursera.

All codes must be run using the CodeSkulptor.

CodeSkulptor is a browser-based Python interpreter, as featured in the online course “An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python”. It implements a subset of Python 2, plus the addition of three graphical libraries, SimpleGui, SimpleMap, and SimplePlot.

These libraries, mainly SimpleGui, do not behave exactly like in the browser interpreter when installed in a computer, that way it is recommended to run the codes using the CodeSkulptor website.
